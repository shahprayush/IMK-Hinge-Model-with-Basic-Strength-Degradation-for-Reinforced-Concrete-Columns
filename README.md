# IMK-Hinge-Model-with-Basic-Strength-Degradation-for-Reinforced-Concrete-Columns
This MATLAB script implements the Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler (IMK) hinge model to simulate the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete columns under seismic loading, specifically focusing on the basic strength degradation type.
